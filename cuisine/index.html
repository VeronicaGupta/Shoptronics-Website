        <center><b><i>AMERICAN CUISINE</b></i><br></center>
        <p>
        American cuisine was influenced by Europeans and Native Americans in its early history. It is one delicacy that’s hard to define, given that it was introduced and influenced by immigrants over the early years. From Northeast to Mid-Atlantic, Southern to Southwest, the eccentric blend of exotic food eventually made America what it is today: a unique myriad of steak houses, sandwich shops and burger joints.<br>
        A true melting pot when it comes to staple ingredients – from chicken, wheat, corn, and bread – these components are key in just about any quintessential American food. The most recognisable ones are the all-time classics such as pizzas, burgers, hotdogs and pot pies.

        European or western cuisine and other Western countries, including the cuisines brought to other countries by European settlers and colonists. East Asians contrast Western cuisine with Asian styles of cooking, the way Westerners refer to the varied cuisines of East Asia as Asian cuisine.<br>
        The potato is a major starch plant in the diet of Europeans and their diaspora since the European colonisation of the Americas. Maize is much less common in most European diets than it is in the Americas; corn meal is a major part of the cuisine of Italy and the Balkans. Although flatbreads and rice are eaten in Europe, they are only staple foods in limited areas, particularly in Southern Europe. Salads (cold dishes with uncooked or cooked vegetables with sauce) are an integral part of European cuisine.

        <center><b><i>AUSTRALIAN CUISINE</b></i><br></center>
        <p>
        Australian cuisine has a unique blend of culinary contributions and adaptations from various cultures around the world, including British, European, Asian and Middle Eastern.<br>
        Australian cuisine in the 21st century reflects the influence of globalisation, with many fast-food restaurants and international trends becoming influential. Organic and biodynamic foods have also become widely available alongside a revival of interest in bush tucker. Australia has become known for the high quality of its exports, with major agricultural industries including cattle, sheep, poultry, milk, vegetables, fruit, nuts, wheat, barley and canola. The country is also well regarded for its locally-made wine, beer and soft drinks.
